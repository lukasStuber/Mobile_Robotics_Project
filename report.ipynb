    "# Project Description\n",
    "The goal of the project in the Basics of Mobile Robotics course was the control of a Thymio, a two wheeled robot. The environment of the robot is a map designed by the group members. On the map need to be obstacles into which the robot must not drive. According to the chosen map and certain fixed obstacles present on the map, a global path from the start to the goal must be calculated using computer vision from an external camera. The start is the initial location of the Thymio, the goal can be placed by the user. On its path to the goal the robot needs to be able to detect and avoid unforeseen obstacles that are added manually. For better tracking of the path some kind of filtering must be used to improve the state estimation of the robot. The camera image serves as measurement for the latter."

    "# Detailed Description of our Choices\n",
    "Our group chose the map to be a parking space with two centered rows of parking spaces. The yellow lines mark the edges of these spaces and are the fixed obstacles used in the global path planning. The robot is neither allowed to cross the yellow lines nor leave the map while following this path. The camera is fixed above the map and oversees the entire situation (robot, lines, free spaces, occupied spaces). To facilitate the detection of the position and orientation of the robot in the images, we stuck two coloured stickers on the top of the robot, right above its wheels. The left sticker is green, the right one is blue. The computer vision algorithm uses these two points to determine the center of the wheels axis and the orientation of the robot. The goal is a free parking space indicated by a red paper square. The unexpected obstacles (ignored by the computer vision) are other Thymio robots. The estimated state correction is done with the help of a Kalman filter whose measurement is the location of the Thymio in the camera images.\n",

    "We use an *AUKEY 1080P - 30 fps* camera as the input for the computer vision. It is fixed on a stand (a lamp) and sees the entire map from above. Its position does not change during the operation of the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable a clear and stable detection of the objects on the map, a series of adjustments are done before the object detection. The image processing is done in HSV representation of the image. The procedure is automatically started when the main function is executed. It includes:\n",

    "# Global Path Planning\n",
    "The global path planning is done using the A* algorithm, as seen in Exercise 5 of the course. It uses the simplified map generated by the computer vision part as input. The typical size of this image is <font color='red'>????</font>, which is far too large for the A* algorithm to finish in an acceptable time. To reduce the size of the image, a convolutional filter is applied to the pixels. Its size (the variable ``kernel``) can be chosen by the user. The filter divides the image from the vision part into square patches of side length $2\\:\\times$ ``kernel`` $+\\:1$. The output pixel is 0 if:\n",
    "- all the pixels in the patch are black (free space)\n",
    "- at least one of the pixels is green or blue (robot position)\n",
    "- at least one of the pixels is red (goal position)\n",
    "The output is 1 if:\n",
    "- at least one of the pixels is yellow (obstacle line)\n",
    "The result of this filtering is a map of typical size 60 by 120 pixels (depending on the size of the input map) where the free, start and goal space is 0 and the obstacle space is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduced map and the start and goal positions are fed into the A* algorithm that calculates the optimal global path from the start to the goal. The calculated path is a series of coordinates in the reduced map format. To serve as directions for the Thymio, these coordinates need to be resized to the original map (multiplied by the reduction factor $2\\:\\times$ ``kernel`` $+\\:1$)."

    "The class ThymioControl in the file ``control.py`` solely handles the interactions between the PC and the Thymio through the ``tdmclient`` library, and contains the related higher-level algorithms for path following and obstacle avoidance. It thus controls the speeds of the robot’s wheels depending on the robot coordinates given by the Kalman filtering module, and then sends the speeds it applied back to the latter.\n",

    "The function ``navigation()``, controlling both path following and obstacle avoidance, is called by the RepeatedTimer ``move_timer`` at a period ``MOVE_INTERVAL``. This function first reads the values of the proximity sensors of the Thymio, and then starts either an obstacle avoidance step if a significant value is read in fron tin the robot, or a path following step if not. This switch is controlled by the value of ``PROX_THRESHOLD``, which is set too 1000, or around 65 millimeters, for our application. The timer interval ``MOVE_INTERVAL`` is set to ``0.21`` seconds to leave time for both fetching of the sensor values and setting new motor values, both having a set duration of 100 milliseconds. ``move_timer`` is started by the function ``follow_path()``, which is called from the main program.\n",

    "The most basic movement function is ``move(l_speed, r_speed)`` which simply sends the desired speeds to the Thymio and records the current speed-target. This communication with the robot has a standard duration of 100 milliseconds, which makes an efficient PID controller running on the computer impossible. A PID running on the Thymio itself was also not desirable due to the frequent sending of observed positions and fetching of estimated positions, requiring event-listeners on both machines, adding more delays to the movement. Running a PID and odometry on the Thymio itself is further impeded by the robot's inability to calculate with floating point values (running odometry on the computer instead would require speed-updates at a very high frequency, which is completely impossible due to the previous reasons).\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus decided to greatly reduce the amount of communications by setting a constant speed for all movements and estimating its duration; the commands sent to the robot are now only the initial start of the movement, and the stopping command after a set duration. In this case, no (relevant) code is flashed onto the Thymio.\n",

This duration is capped at 0.5 seconds to allow re-orientation in case of an asynchronous Kalman update.\n",

    "In case an obstacle is detected by the front proximity sensors, ``navigation()`` calls the function ``avoid_obstacles()``. This function first stops ``stop_timer`` and its boolean in case the path following function has activated it, then calculates the speeds of both wheels using a dot product on coefficients. These coefficients make the robot turn if the obstacle is detected on the sides, and move backwards when it lies right in front of the Thymio (since the readings are practically never symmetrical, the middle coefficient has never led to a draw by repetition). Furthermore, if the obstacle is only found at the extremities of the sensed space, the robot will keep moving forward at half its standard speed. The side on which the obstacle has been found is then saved in ``obst_direction``, the speed sent to the robot, and the function starts anew while ``navigation()`` detects a significant presence in front of the robot.\n",

    "Once the obstacle disappears or is completely avoided, the robot will re-enter ``move_to_goal()`` and use the last computed value of ``obst_direction`` to spurt forward while slightly turning towards the obstacle for ``OBST_TIME = 1`` seconds, in hopes of landing beyond it. This value along with ``OBST_SPEED`` and ``OBST_TURN_SPEED`` has been calibrated for driving past another immobile Thymio. It must be noted that the yellow lines of the map are ignored for the entire avoidance sequence, and also once the path following sets in again; these markings are only used during the pathfinding to place the checkpoints the robot has to travel through. The Thymio will also keep circling around the obstacle while the latter covers its next checkpoint.\n",
