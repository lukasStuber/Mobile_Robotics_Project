    "# Project Description\n",
    "The goal of the project of Basics Mobile Robotics class was the control of a two wheeled Thymio robot. The environment of the robot is a map designed by the group members. On the map there need to be obstacles into which the robot must not drive. According to the map and certain fixed obstacles present on the map, a global path from the start to the goal must be calculated using computer vision from an external camera. The start is the initial location of the Thymio, the goal can be placed by the user. On its path to the goal the robot needs to be able to detect and avoid unforeseen obstacles that are added manually. For better tracking of the path some kind of filtering must be used to improve the state estimation of the robot. The camera image serve as measurements for the latter."

    "# Detailed Description of our Choices\n",
    "We chosed the map to be a parking with two rows of parking lots arround and between which the Thymio will move. \n",
    "\n",
    "The yellow lines mark the edges of the parking lots and are the fixed obstacles used in the global path planning. The robot is neither allowed to cross the yellow lines nor leave the map while following this path. The camera is fixed above the map and oversees the entire situation (robot, lines, free spaces, occupied spaces). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to detect the position and orientation of the robot, we sticked a green and a blue stickers on the top of it, right above its wheels. The computer vision algorithm uses these two points to determine the center of the wheels axis and the orientation of the robot. The goal is a free parking space indicated by a red square paper. The unexpected obstacles (ignored by the computer vision) are some objects that we add on Thymio's path. There is also an other Thymio covered by a yellow paper (i.e. considered at first as a global obstacle because of the yellow color) that we control remotely to get out of its parking lot and get in the Thymio's path, as if it was a bad driver. The obstacle avoidance will then avoid this bad driver, as in assisted driving. \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated state correction is done with the help of a Kalman filter whose measurement is the location of the Thymio in the camera images.\n",

A PID running on the Thymio itself was also not desirable due to the frequent sending of observed positions and fetching of estimated positions, requiring event-listeners on both machines, adding more delays to the movement.

    "In case an obstacle is detected by the front proximity sensors, ``navigation()`` calls the function ``avoid_obstacles()``. This function first stops ``stop_timer`` and its boolean in case the path following function has activated it, then calculates the speeds of both wheels using a dot product on coefficients. These coefficients make the robot turn if the obstacle is detected on the sides, and move backwards when it lies right in front of the Thymio (since the readings are practically never symmetrical, the middle coefficient has never led to a draw by repetition). Furthermore, if the obstacle is only found at the extremities of the sensed space, the robot will keep moving forward at half its standard speed. The side on which the obstacle has been found is then saved in ``obst_direction``, the speed sent to the robot, and the function starts anew while ``navigation()`` detects a significant presence in front of the robot.\n",

This value along with ``OBST_SPEED`` and ``OBST_TURN_SPEED`` has been calibrated for driving past another immobile Thymio. It must be noted that the yellow lines of the map are ignored for the entire avoidance sequence, and also once the path following sets in again; these markings are only used during the pathfinding to place the checkpoints the robot has to travel through.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "All the main modules of the project were implemented and tested. The Thymio can operate on a parking lot with two lines of spaces. This includes finding the goal parking lot, navigating around the other spaces, avoid unforeseen obstacles such as other cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible improvements\n",
    "- The pathfinding algorithm tends to return a jagged path, which can lead to unnecessary movements of the robot even after removing most of the intermediary points. This could be improved by adding a turning penalty to the A* algorithm.\n",
    "- The obstacle avoidance is very basic, and assumes the next checkpoint is beyond the obstacle. Since this is not always the case, the robot might spurt past the obstacle and then have to turn around. The spurt could be replaced by a mixed movement, composed of both obstacle avoidance and path following.\n",
    "- The path following is also very crude: it only tries to reach the next checkpoint and does not take into account the checkpoints after that. This means that the robot might overshoot the checkpoint and then turn around, even though it would be faster to carry on to the next one. Similarly, after going off-path during the obstacle avoidance, rejoining the path at a later checkpoint might be faster. This might be achieved by, for example, projecting the current position onto the path.\n",
    "- The Kalman filter obviously suffers from an offset on the position due to perspective, since the reference points on the Thymio are not on the ground plane. This leads to the robot driving closer to the center of the map than it should during path following, and some Kalman corrections confusing the odometric estimations. This could be solved with this trigonometric offset being taken into account in the state correction function."
